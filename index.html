            <h2 id="origin-cats">The origin of the Cats</h2>
            <p>
            According to a recent study by Claudio Ottoni, cat domestication took place in two strains, but all domestic cats have a common ancestor: the North African / Southwest Asian wildcat, Felis silvestris lybica (Ottoni and others 2017). By studying ancient cat DNA from all over the world, the researchers found that cat domestication began in the Fertile Crescent (in the Neolithic period) and accelerated later in ancient Egypt (in the Classical period) (Ottoni and others 2017). Other scientists have also discovered another potential instance of cat domestication. J.D. Vigne studied skeletal remains of cats in China and found that there may have been a short-lived domestication of leopards in China, independent of domestication elsewhere (Vigne and others 2016). However, they did not find evidence that any present day domesticated cats are related to leopards, so if there was a time that they were domesticated, it did not last (Vigne and others 2016).

            The domestic cat (Felis catus) is one of the most recently evolved species within the Felidae family.
            The Felidae family have been split into three general:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Panthera (cats that roar – lions, tigers, leopards, snow leopards, clouded leopards and jaguars)</li>
                <li>Acinonyx (the Cheetah)</li>
                <li>Felis (all other ‘small’ cats)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the classification of the Felidae family is difficult, in part because of the difficulty in distinguishing species by their phenotype and morphology – they all look remarkably similar and, for example, it is extremely difficult for even trained experts to differentiate the skull of a lion from that of a tiger. More recent genetic investigations have suggested eight distinct clusterings or lineages within the Felidae family which could therefore form the basis of their reclassification in the future.

            <p> We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. Factors such a s age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat.

            Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balance d foods will contain taurine.
            You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily.
            Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.
            Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, y our pet could be poisoned.
            Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.
            Please visit our People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets page for a list of off-limits items, as well as our Cat Nutrition Tips page for more information.

                Chlamydophila, Leukaemia, Panleukopenia are just some of the words you may hear your veterinarian referring to when discussing cat diseases in the community.  With a cross between medical terminology and more common names, it can all get a little confusing. So to help out here is a list of the most commonly discussed cat diseases we vaccinate against and some of the names you will hear used.
